This project was built during Stephen Grider's Course on Advanced React Native on udemy.com, where he teaches on how to use the React Native's Animation Library(Animated) to achieve Tinder's Swipe Deck. 

It was a great building this project over a course of around 32 videos and discussed on how to use interpolation methods, to translate as well as rotate the deck.
